## Note-App
# Simple Note App

This is a simple note-taking web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create and delete notes that are stored locally in their browser's storage. The application features a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Create Notes**: Users can click the "Create" button to create a new note. Each note can be edited and customized according to their needs.

- **Edit Notes**: The notes are editable. Simply click on a note to start editing its content.

- **Delete Notes**: Each note has a delete button represented by a trash can icon. Clicking this icon will remove the note.

- **Local Storage**: The application uses local storage to persist the notes. This means that even if you close the browser, your notes will be saved and will reappear when you revisit the app.

- **Enter Key Support**: Pressing the "Enter" key creates a new line within a note, making it easier to structure your text.
